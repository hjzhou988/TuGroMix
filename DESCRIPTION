Title: Statistical Analysis of Mouse Tumor Growth Curves Based on
    Mixed-Effects Models
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Huajun Zhou
Maintainer: Huajun Zhou <hjzhou988@gmail.com>
Description: The package uses linear mixed-effects model (LMM) and
    generalized additive model (GAM) to test the significance of
    anti-cancer drug treatment effect on mouse tumor growth curves
    (primary tumor-derived xenografted mice (PDX), cancer cell
    line-derived xenografted mice (CDX), etc). It can also be used for
    biomarker discovery, given drug testing results in different PDXs
    (CDXs), along with known gene expression/mutation data in these PDXs
    (CDXs). The biomarker discovery can take a long time, since it's
    screening thousands of genes. The package also integrates a
    multi-threading function, so that it can be run on a computing
    cluster.
